This Unity project demonstrates an Augmented Reality (AR) application that overlays different tumor models on a pelvis bone model. The application allows users to select different tumor models through a dropdown menu, toggle the visibility of a bounding sphere around the tumors, and adjust the margings based on tumor size. Additionally, it allows the user to overlay a 3D virtual model of the pelvic bone of the patient to visualize both 

Features
